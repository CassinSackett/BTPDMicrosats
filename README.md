Microsatellite genotypes for black-tailed prairie dogs in Boulder County, CO

This repository contains raw microsatellite genotypes for black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in Boulder County, Colorado. Prairie dogs were sampled from 2003 - 2009. When an individual was sampled in multiple years, its genotype was included only once.

These data were used in two publications:
1 - L.C. Sackett, T.B. Cross*, R.T. Jones, W. Johnson, K. Ballare, C. Ray, S.K. Collinge, A.P. Martin 2012. Connectivity of prairie dog colonies in an altered landscape: inferences from analysis of microsatellite DNA variation. Conservation Genetics 13: 407 – 418.
2 - L.C. Sackett, S.K. Collinge, A.P. Martin 2013.  Do pathogens reduce genetic diversity of their hosts? Variable effects of sylvatic plague in black-tailed prairie dogs. Molecular Ecology 22: 2441 – 2455.

Development of the markers is described in:
L.C. Sackett, L.K. Etchberger, M.N. Mazzella*, D.D. Lim*, A.P. Martin 2010. Characterization of 18 microsatellite loci for three species of prairie dogs. Molecular Ecology Resources 10: 232–236.
